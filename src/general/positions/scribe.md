## Expectations
| Duties | What it means to our Troop |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| Attends and keeps a log of patrol leaders’ council meetings. | If the Scribe is unable to attend a PLC meeting, they should notify the SPL and Scoutmaster as soon as reasonably possible.  The SPL should identify and recommend to the Scoutmaster a scout to attend as “acting Scribe” for the PLC meeting.  The Scoutmaster must approve any appointment for “acting Scribe”.  In the absence of a Scribe or “acting Scribe” at the PLC meeting, the SPL will be responsible for fulfilling the Scribe’s duties.<br>- PLC meetings should be held at least once a month and are typically 1.5 hours.<br>- Scribe must attend all PLC meetings.<br>- Keep a written record (physical notepad or digital wireless device) of each PLC meeting and what is discussed.<br>- Prior to the end of the PLC meeting, review your written record with the PLC to ensure it is complete and accurate.  Make any necessary corrections.<br>- After the PLC meeting, share the written record of the PLC meeting with the PLC and Scoutmaster using a Troop Track E-mail.  If the written record was created on a physical notepad, the notes will need to be transcribed to the Troop Track E-mail.  This Troop Track E-mail should be sent within 24 hours after the meeting.<br>- Distribute copies of the PLC log at the Troop Meeting immediately following the PLC.  This can be done via e-mail or a printout. |
| Records individual Scout attendance and dues payments. | - Troop 901 utilizes Troop Track to record Scout attendance.  The Scribe should review the Scout attendance against the RSVP list in Troop Track for the activity/event/campout.  Any discrepancies should be reported to the Advancement Coordinator via Troo Track e-mail.  For examples, scouts that RSVP’d as “Going” but did not attend, or scouts that attended but did not RSVP as “Going”.<br>- Troop 901 utilizes Troop Track to record Scout payments of dues using their “Scout money account”.  Consequently, the Scribe does not record or track dues payments in Troop 901.
| Records individual Scout advancement progress. | - Troop 901 utilizes Troop Track to record Scout advancement.  In Troop 901, the individual Scouts are responsible for getting their advancement completions to the Advancement Coordinator, typically after their SM conference and before scheduling their Board of Review.<br>- Provide Advancement Coordinator the names of Scouts who completed other awards such as Totin’ Chip and Firem’n Chit.<br>- After elections and after the Scoutmaster approves the SPL nominations for PLC, the Scribe provides the Advancement Coordinator the names of Scouts serving in positions of responsibility.  These positions will be recorded in Troop Track under each Scout’s “Leadership” tab. |
| Works with the troop committee member responsible for records and finance. | - Meet with the Advancement Coordinator quarterly (every 3 months) to confirm the troop’s advancement records are orderly and complete.  This meeting typically happens before the Court of Honor to finalize the COH program.<br>- The Treasurer may reach out to the Scribe to confirm contact information for a scout. |
| Sets a good example. | - Be the first to reflect the Scout Sign.<br>- Maintain a positive and enthusiastic attitude.<br>- Exhibit good self-discipline.<br>- Have a good attendance record.<br>- Meet your obligations on time and in full effort.<br>- Have fun but not at the expense of everyone.<br>- Goofing off without purpose wastes time and loses the interest and respect of the other Scouts.<br>- REMEMBER:  The Troop will follow your example.
| Wears the Scout uniform correctly. | - Wear the uniform properly, including the following:<br>&emsp;• Shoulder epaulet loops<br>&emsp;• Left sleeve: council patch, troop number, current position patch, “Trained” patch (after completing ILST)<br>&emsp;• Right sleeve: US flag, patrol patch, Journey to Excellence Patch (optional)<br>&emsp;• Left pocket: current Rank patch<br>&emsp;• Uniform should always be buttoned (except top button) and tucked into shorts/pants with a belt.  This should be done before arriving at the meeting/event location.<br>&emsp;• At Courts of Honor or other distinguished events, wear the neckerchief with slide and merit badge sash appropriately. |
| Lives by the Scout Oath and Law. | - Use the Scout Oath and Law as an everyday guideline. |
| Shows Scout spirit. | - Actively and enthusiastically participate in troop activities. |
