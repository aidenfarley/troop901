Each position should meet with their advisor monthly, preferably at the monthly PLC meeting, to discuss the Scout’s performance and review their progress towards meeting these expectations.  The goal is to provide feedback throughout the term so the Scout can, if necessary, improve performance throughout the term.

## Expectations
| Duties | What it means to our Troop |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| Sets up and takes care of the Troop library | - Establishes semi-portable means to properly store library of materials.  This could be a cardboard box, accordion file folder, or some other type of filing system.<br>- At least once per term, review the inventory of content for relevance and accuracy.  BSA periodically adjusts Merit Badge requirements and the pamphlets should be updates if they are no longer accurate.  Most BSA adjustments are minor and can be annotated in the pamphlets.<br>- Ensure the library is stored safely in a climate-controlled dry location.<br>- Carefully transport the library to and from Troop meetings and PLC meetings as needed to support the agenda. |
|Keeps records of books and pamphlets owned by the troop.| - Create a catalog/list of all books and pamphlets owned by the troop in Troop Track Library. <br>- At least once per term, share the list of materials available to the troop via Troop Track E-mail.|
| Adds new or replacement items as needed. | - Make a list of books or pamphlets that should be added to the library.  Ideally, all merit badge pamphlets for the Eagle-required merit badges should be included in the library.<br>- Review the list with the SPL.  Provide the list to the Scoutmaster to seek approval for the purchasing of the merit badge pamphlets.<br>- Once approved, purchase the additional materials and add them to the catalog of the library.
| Keeps books and pamphlets available for borrowing. | - The merit badge pamphlets should be brought to at least one Troop meeting per month.  Scouts may request a specific merit badge pamphlet any time and the Librarian should bring it to the next available meeting or coordinate with the Scout to check out the pamphlet.<br>- The program features chapter for the upcoming month should be provided to the PLC at least one week before the PLC meeting.  If attending the PLC meeting, the Librarian should bring the program features guides to the meeting. |
| Keeps a system for checking books and pamphlets in and out, and follows up on late returns. | - Troop Track Library has a system for checking materials in and out.  Librarian should utilize this system.<br>- Librarian should review who has the checked out materials monthly and follow up with any scouts that have not returned materials in a timely manner.
